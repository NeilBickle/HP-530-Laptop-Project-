# HP-530-Laptop-Project-Main-Branch
This is going to be a little bit of a different repository as it will have images of my project and code of which I have made on the laptop to show my adaptability to the older software and how I can adapt to different software.

# Start Of Project 

1. 15/02/20

# Software Used 

1. Microsoft Frontpage
2. Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
3. Mozilla Firefox
4. Notepad

# What i want to achieve with this project
1. Improve my adaptiability to software not just older software but as A skill.
2. Improve my troubleshooting skillset by learning from older software where you can run into bugs or problems that other people might not have. 
3. Improve my skillset in legacy software, a little bit of a story here but i myself like to code medical applications and as it has been stated in reports the NHS is still on Windows XP in somecases, so i went with Windows 2000 as the most XP compatible.
4. To get a OS the is not made for a piece of hardware to work on this piece of hardware, if you dont know Windows 2000 was never actually offically compatible with the HP 530 so i set myself the challenge of making Windows 2000 work on the HP 530.
